# P2Lock!!

This is a discord bot that Locks your hunts, rares and regionals and more! (toggleable).

Basically does the same-ish thing as Pok√©-Lock (+ Rare/Regional lock)

[Bot invite if you wanna add the actual bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=806723110761136169&permissions=67696&scope=bot)
---
## Building the bot

- [Go to the discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Click on "New Application" and give it a name (can be changed later). Click on copy ID.
- Customise whatever you want and then click on "Bot" on the left side.
- Scroll down and enable all the three intents and then get the bot's token.
- You can toggle whether you want the bot to be Public or not (Public allows others to add the bot to their servers)
- Then go  up to "Oauth2" and click on URL Generator.
- Under "Scopes" click on "bot" and then scroll down to select the bot's permissions (mostly needs Manage Channels)
- After doing this you can invite the bot to your server

## Making the bot alive

- Download all the files (License and README unnecessary) and put them wherever you're hosting the bot
(If you're hosting it on your device, you'll need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- You will probably need to run "npm i discord.js@v12" in the terminal if you're hosting it locally
- open "config.json" and add the values for token, BotID and prefix (you should've copied the bot's ID and token during "Building the bot")
- Click on "run" or type "npm run bot" in the console!
